<h3>Using the Viewer</h3>

<p><b>Zooming</b><br />
When an image is first displayed in the viewer, the zoom size will be slightly larger than the available space in your window. 
Most images will have multiple zoom levels to allow users to see an entire image, or to see detail within a certain portion of the image. 
Zooming can be accomplished in the following ways: 
<ul>
<li>In the image Navigator, click the <b>+</b> to zoom in or <b>-</b> to zoom out</li>
<li>On the image, double-click to zoom in, hold [<b>shift</b>] and double-click to zoom out</li>
<li>In both the image Navigator and image, move your mouse scroll wheel up to zoom in and down to zoom out</li>
<li>Using your keyboard, press the [<b>+</b>] to zoom in or the [<b>-</b>] key to zoom out</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Panning</b><br />
When an image is larger than the available space in your window, the viewer will allow the image to be panned in any direction where the image is overflowing. 
The image navigator will indicate the portion of the image currently being viewed with a grey box. Any portion of the image outside of the grey box can be viewed by panning in the appropriate direction.
Panning can be done in any of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>In the image Navigator, click one the four triangle arrow buttons to pan the image in the desired direction</li>
<li>In the image Navigator, click and hold the grey box to drag it to the desired position</li>
<li>In the image Navigator, click outside of grey box to center your view on the selected point</li>
<li>On the image, click and hold the left mouse button to drag the image to the desired location</li>
<li>Using your keyboard, press one of the arrow keys to pan the image in the desired direction</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Rotation</b><br />
In the image Navigator, click one of the rotate arrow buttons to rotate the image left or right in 90&deg; increments.
</p>

<p><b>Download</b><br />
In the image Navigator, click the download arrow button to view the available download options.  
These options will be visible in a floating panel.  
Clicking an icon at the top of the panel will show a different sized image.  
From the left, the first icon will show an image of what is currently in your viewport. 
Each icon to the right will show the complete image, increasing in size as you move to the right. 
If an image has been rotated, all of the download options will be rotated in a similar fashon. 
</p>

<p><b>Refresh</b><br />
If there are tiles that are not being displayed correctly, they can be reloaded by clicking the <b>Refresh</b> button, or by pressing [F5] on your keyboard
</p>

<h3>About the technology</h3>
<p>Megapixel images are difficult to display online.  The images in our collections often reach sizes over 100MB and are highly detailed, which is difficult to deliver with standard image formats.  We wanted to provide a rich browsing environment that let users zoom in and out to see greater detail and simply click and drag to view more of the image, similar in functionality to Google Maps.</p>
<p>We encode our archival JPG and TIF images into JPEG2000 format and place those files on our web server.  As you interact with our images, the <a href="http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/documentation/iipmooviewer/" target="_blank">IIP Viewer</a> uses JavaScript running on your browser send instructions about what zoom level and area you'd like to view to the <a href="http://african.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/" target="_blank">aDORe djatoka Image Server</a>, also installed on our server.  This technique is commonly known as Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, although technically we are not using the XMLHttpRequest object to interchange data.</p>
<p>The viewer is a modified version of the <a href="http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/documentation/iipmooviewer/" target="_blank">IIPMooViewer</a> project that has been enhanced and adapted to communicate with the <a href="http://african.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/" target="_blank">aDORe djatoka Image Server</a>.</p>
<p>The image server is an open source Linux project named <a href="http://african.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/" target="_blank">aDORe djatoka</a>. It is designed to consume JP2 images on the server and return sized and cropped jpg images to the client.</p>
