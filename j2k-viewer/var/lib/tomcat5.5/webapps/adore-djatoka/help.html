	<h3>More Info</h3>
	<p>
		Megapixel images are difficult to display online.  The images in our collections often reach sizes over 100MB and are highly detailed, 
		which is difficult to deliver with standard image formats.  We wanted to provide a rich browsing environment that let users zoom in and 
		out to see greater detail and simply click and drag to view more of the image, similar in functionality to Google Maps.
	</p>
	<p>
		We encode our archival TIF images into JPEG2000 (and previously MrSID) format and place those files on our web server.  
		As you interact with our images, JavaScripts running on your browser send instructions about what zoom level and
		area you'd like to view to <a href="http://african.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/">Adore-Djatoka</a>, also installed on our server.  This technique is commonly known 
		as Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, although technically we are not using the XMLHttpRequest object to interchange data.
