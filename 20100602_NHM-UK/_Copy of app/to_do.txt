						These magic functions can be used as a shortcut to search your tables for a row given a certain field, and a certain value. Just tack on the name of the field you wish to search, and CamelCase it. Examples (as used in a Controller) might be:
						$this->Post->findByTitle('My First Blog Post');
						$this->Author->findByLastName('Rogers');
						$this->Property->findAllByState('AZ');
						$this->Specimen->findAllByKingdom('Animalia');

						The returned result is an array formatted just as would be from find() or findAll()."
