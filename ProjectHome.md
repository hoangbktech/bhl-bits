This is the repository for code from various Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) projects, all of which are released under various Open Source licenses.  Our current portal website runs on .NET, connects to a MSSQL backend database, and utilizes an Apache Tomcat webapp fronted image viewer.  Our new citation web site runs under Linux (Debian), Drupal, Apache, PHP and MySQL with help from HAProxy, Solr/Lucene, OpenVZ, KVM and other software.  We'll be releasing code, as well as the all important configuration files for applications we use and support on our servers.  We're open to any and all suggestions from the community, and of course accept any patches that improve our code.  We appreciate your interest in our projects.
